          <h1>BRIEF HISTORY </h1>
          <p>
            The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) is a political party in Nigeria that was founded on June 21, 2002. The party was formed by a group of politicians, including Chief Chekwas Okorie, who believed in the principles of good governance, democracy, and social justice.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutussub">Here is a brief history of the APGA party:</span>
            <br>
            
            <span class="aboutustopic">Formation:</span> APGA was formed as a response to the political landscape in Nigeria at the time, with a focus on promoting Igbo interests and providing an alternative political platform for the people of the Southeast region.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2003 Elections:</span> APGA participated in its first general elections in 2003. The party gained significant popularity in the Southeast and won the governorship election in Anambra State with Chief Chris Uba as the candidate.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2006 Crisis:</span> In 2006, a leadership crisis emerged within APGA, leading to factionalism and legal battles over the control of the party. This crisis resulted in multiple court cases and challenges to the party's leadership.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2007 Elections:</span> Despite the internal crisis, APGA participated in the 2007 general elections and won the governorship election in Anambra State with Mr. Peter Obi as the candidate. This victory helped solidify the party's presence in the Southeast.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2010 Reconciliation:</span> Efforts were made to reconcile the factions within APGA, and in 2010, a semblance of unity was achieved with Chief Victor Umeh emerging as the National Chairman of the party.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2013 Elections:</span> APGA continued to participate in subsequent elections, both at the state and national levels. The party maintained a strong presence in Anambra State and other parts of the Southeast.
            <br>
            <span class="aboutustopic">2019 Elections:</span> In the 2019 general elections, APGA fielded candidates for various positions across the country. While the party faced challenges in some areas, it continued to be a significant player in Southeast politics.
            <br>
            Throughout its history, APGA has been known for its advocacy of Igbo interests, promotion of good governance, and commitment to grassroots mobilization. The party has had its share of internal challenges and external pressures but has remained a key player in Nigerian politics, particularly in the Southeast region.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="electhistory">ELECTORAL HISTORY</span>
            <br>
            At the legislative elections held on 12 April 2003, the party won 1.4% of popular votes and 2 of 360 seats in the House of Representatives of Nigeria but no seats in the Senate. Its candidate at the presidential elections of 19 April 2003, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, won 3.3% of the vote.
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            In gubernatorial elections of April 2011, Chief Rochas Okorocha (APGA) was elected governor of Imo state, polling 15% more votes than incumbent governor Ikedi Ohakim (PDP). An APGA candidate was first elected as governor of Anambra state.
            <br>
            In February 2013, a faction of the party merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria, the All Nigeria Peoples Party, and the Congress for Progressive Change to form the All Progressives Congress (APC). 
            <br>
            The party currently has a governor, who currently governs Anambra State, South Eastern, Nigeria. Also, in January 2018, the party clinched a seat in the Senate after a by-election. All Local Government Area Chairmen in Anambra State, are Card-carrying members of APGA.
            The party experienced remarkable growth during the 2019 elections as it won 7 seats in the House of representatives compared to the 2015 elections where only two seats were won.
